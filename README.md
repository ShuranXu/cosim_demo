# File-Based Câ†”RTL Co-Sim Skeleton Framework

This is a tiny, portable framework where a **C testbench** produces input vectors and checks outputs, while a **Verilog DUT** consumes/produces those via simple `.dat` files. The simulator is launched from C in **batch mode** (Questa/ModelSim).

## Flow

1. `sw/main.c` writes `sim/in.dat` (decimal, one integer per line).
2. C spawns `vsim -do sim/run.do` (or ModelSim equivalent).
3. Verilog DUT reads `sim/in.dat`, processes one sample per clock, writes `sim/out.dat`.
4. C blocks until the simulator exits, then reads `sim/out.dat` and compares against golden results.

## Requirements

- Linux/macOS (Windows works too; adjust `VSIM_CMD` if needed)
- QuestaSim or ModelSim on PATH (`vsim` available)
- GCC or Clang

## Quick Start

To perform the simulation, run the following command:

```bash
make run
```

The simulation output should match the screenshot shown below:
